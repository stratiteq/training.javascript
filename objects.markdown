### Ways to create objects

#### Constructor
*    - "this" reference

#### Singleton (Literal)
*    - References itself through an assigned variable
*    - Functions executed during creation cannot reference itself

#### Singleton (IIFE)
*    + Provides closure

#### Factory / Augmentation factory
*    + Provides closure
*    + Allows several "sets" to be applied to the same object (pseudo interface)
*    + Easy scoping to the object
*    - Has a "this" reference
